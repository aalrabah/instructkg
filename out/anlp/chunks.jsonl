Contextual Embeddings\n2. Pre-train embeddings using large unlabeled datasets. Two strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks:\n- Feature-based approach , uses task-specific architectures that include the pretrained representations as additional features (i.e., ELMo (Peters et al., 2018)).\n- Fine-tuning approach , introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pretrained parameters, using smaller datasets with task-specific labels (i.e., the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) or BERT (Devlin et al, 2019)).", "prev_chunk_id": "ALecture6_LSTM_ModelArchitectures_ContextualEmbeddings__0048", "next_chunk_id": "ALecture6_LSTM_ModelArchitectures_ContextualEmbeddings__0050"}

How many hours will it take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes?\nMoDEL ANSWER (CORRECT): It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a large hole. So it takes Matthew 3 x 30 = 90 minutes to dig 30 small holes. It takes Matthew 10 x 15 = 150 minutes to dig 15 large holes. So it takes Matthew 90 + 150 = 240 minutes to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. 240 minutes is 4 hours.

I have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. So I have 10 + 15 = 25 liters of drink. I spill one liter of orange drink. So I have 24 liters of drink. 25 - 24 is 1.

However, understanding diverse, ambiguous language commands is challenging. Grounding language to structured task specifications enables autonomous robots to understan d a broad range of natural language and solve long-horizon tasks with safety guarantees. Linear temporal logic (LTL) provides unambiguous semantics for language grounding, and its compositionality can induce skill transfer.\nIn this talk, I will first propose two language grounding systems. 1) Lang2LTL is a modular system that uses large language models (LLMs) to ground navigation commands with diverse temporal patterns to LTL task specifications in novel environments without retraining. 2) Improved upon its predecessor, Lang2LTL-2 uses LLMs and a pretrained vision-language model to ground spatiotemporal navigation commands. By translating language to LTL, both systems can detect infeasible task specifications and abort execution when necessary. 3) Next, I will introduce LTL-Transfer, a zero-shot transfer algorithm that leverages the compositionality of LTL to reuse learned skills to solve novel tasks without violating any safety constraints. In future work, I want to develop robotic systems that produce robust and verifiable behavior by integrating mul timodal grounding and human-robot dialogue.", "prev_chunk_id": "ALecture13_ToolCalling__0061", "next_chunk_id": "ALecture13_ToolCalling__0063"}

Then the number of diamonds is 175. And the number of emeralds is 2(x-35), since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies and there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.\nTo find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: Total gems = 175 + x + 2(x-35) = 3x + 105.\nWe don't know the exact value of x, but we do know that it represents the number of rubies, which is less than 175 (since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds). Let's try some values of x: If x = 50, then the total gems = 3(50) + 105 = 255. If x = 100, then the total gems = 3(100) + 105 = 405.\nSince we know there were fewer rubies than diamonds, the answer must be closer to 255 than to 405. After some trial and error, we can find that x = 40 gives us: Total gems = 3(40) + 105 = 225.\nAgent 2: If there were 175 diamonds, then the number of rubies is 35 fewer, or 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.\nAnd since there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, we can represent the number of emeralds as 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds.\nTo find the total number of gems in the chest, we can add up the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

However, the agent who found 225 gems assumed that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies minus 35, rather than twice the number of rubies.
